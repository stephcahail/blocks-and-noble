This project is a prototype of an e-book retail website organized with smart contracts.

This prototype is based on the Pete's Pet Shop tutorial: https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop
(If I'm not giving credit where it's due properly, then please let me know so I can do so :) )

To initialize truffle, run "truffle init" in the command line. Since the migrations and contracts are already in place, then answer "N" to everything.

Please let me know if you have any questions or issues by emailing me: stephcahail@gmail.com. Or, if you know me personally please reach out in other ways that may be more convenient. :)
